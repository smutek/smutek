### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a web developer, musician, and general tech nerd from Baltimore, Maryland. Iâ€™m a dad, a husband, and a late life diagnosed autistic. I am generally obsessed with computers, computer programming, info-sec, digital art, and electronic music production.

I like to make electronic music with my drum machines and synths, and Iâ€™m a tech and computer nerd in general so I enjoy learning about programming, information security, and operating systems as a hobby. Iâ€™m a Mac user but I also nerd out a lot on various flavors of Linux. Python is my favorite language but I can also program with PHP and JavaScript.

I'm disabled by the effects of autistic burnout and three and a half years of working in a toxic environment and I'm currently trying to put my life back together. I hope to eventually return to working on the web in some capacity.

I openly identify as anti-fascist and anti-racist because fascism and racism are bad. I believe trans rights are human rights and I believe Black Lives Matter.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a rebuild of my web development blog. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning foundational PHP and Javascript to refresh and strengthen my foundation as a developer.
